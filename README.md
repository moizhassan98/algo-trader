# algo-trader

An interface between TradingView and exchange/brokerage Trading Platforms. Strategies created in PineScript with alerts set to the webhook URL for this server will convert these alerts from Trading view to open trading positions on the Trading Platforms. Binance Margin Trading would be supported and then Maybe MT4.
